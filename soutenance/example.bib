	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network made up of a large number of devices that collaborate to provide various service for the beneﬁt of society. Two communication modes are required to enable a smooth collaboration. A device can send the same message to several other ones participating in the same service. It may also address a speciﬁc device in a Peer-to-Peer manner. The ﬁrst mode of communication is called Group Communication, while we refer to the second as Device-to-Device Communication. One of the main challenges facing the IoT is how to secure these two modes of communication. Among all the security issues, the Key Management is one of the most challenging. This is mainly due to the fact that most of the IoT devices have limited resources in terms of storage, calculation, communication and energy. Although diﬀerent approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem, each of them presents its own limitations and weaknesses. Moreover, they usually consider either the Group or the Device-to-Device Communication. In this paper, we propose a novel versatile Key Management protocol for the Internet of Things. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst protocol that secures both modes of communication at the same time. We then analyze the security and performance of our solution and compare it to the existing schemes. For Group Communication, we show that our solution ensures the forward and backward secrecy and, unlike most of the existing Group Key Management protocols, guarantees the secure coexistence of several services in the network. With regard to Device-to-Device Communication, we prove that our solution is ﬂexible and provides a good level of resilience and network connectivity compared to the existing Peer-to-Peer Key Management schemes. We ﬁnally demonstrate that, by balancing the loads between the heterogeneous devices according to their capabilities, our solution is both eﬃcient and scalable.},

	abstract = {This paper presents GREP, a highly scalable and efﬁcient group rekeying protocol with the following merits. First, it rekeys the group with only two messages, introducing an overhead which is small, constant, and independent of the group size. Second, GREP considers collusion as a ﬁrst-class attack. Third, GREP efﬁciently recovers the group from a collusion attack without recourse to a total member reinitialization. The recovery cost smoothly grows with the group size, and gradually increases with the attack severity. GREP achieves these results by organizing nodes into logical subgroups and exploiting the history of node joining events. This allows GREP to establish a total ordering among subgroups and among nodes in each subgroup, so making collusion recovery highly scalable and efﬁcient. We evaluate performance from several standpoints, and show that GREP is deployable in large-scale networks of customary, even resource constrained, platforms.},

	title = {Energy-{Efﬁcient} {Communication} {Protocol} for {Wireless} {Microsensor} {Networks}},
	abstract = {Wireless distributed microsensor systems will enable the reliable monitoring of a variety of environments for both civil and military applications. In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have signiﬁcant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our ﬁndings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multihop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.},
