	abstract = {IoT Consist of interrelated devices such as digital devices, mechanical devices, computer system, sensors, etc. for transceiving the information over the network. The scalability is essential to enhance the energy utilization and the performance of the environment, while mobility enhances the coverage of the system. Key management is vital for encrypted information transmitted over the network. Although many key management techniques are available, still it is a challenging issue concerning energy and computational cost, so robust key management technique is required that guarantees the required security requirements. In this paper, we proposed a cognitive key management technique (CKMT). The CKMT mechanism is helpful for key management and maintenance in a cluster-based mobile environment that reduces the rekeying process which is required for the mobile node when it enters the new location area, thereby reducing the computational overhead and enhances the scalability to large size network which makes our scheme more robust because strong key management technique is important while providing security services. Initially, we form a cluster, then Cluster-Head (CH) will be elected, it’s a coordinator node that acts as a key manager. We also made an assumption that the sensors and Cluster-Heads are mobile, they can be able to shift from one position to another. This CH oversees and keeps up the private keys of sensors. When CH changes its location, it will hand over its responsibilities to the other CH in the network for uninterrupted communication. Our scheme uses local keys and foreign keys for each node and pairwise key is used only for the common nodes among the cluster so our scheme reduces the computational cost in the network under mobility condition. The results show that our proposed algorithm lowers the overhead in terms of computational costs, energy consumption, and delay.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing involvement of the Internet of Things (IoT) in many of our daily activities, with the aim of improving their efﬁciency and effectiveness. We are witnessing the advent of smart cities, in which IoT is exploited to improve the management of a city’s assets, as well as smart factories, where IoT is paving the way for the forth industrial revolution. These applications and many other ones imply several non-functional requirements to be satisﬁed by the adopted IoT solution, where security assumes paramount importance. Secure communications among the IoT nodes are strongly needed due to the use of wireless technologies that are easy to eavesdrop, in order to steal valuable information. Accordingly, conﬁdentiality is a fundamental prerequisite, but the existing solutions based on transport-level encryption are ineffective, while the ones with application-level encryption may be too expensive in terms of energy consumption. In this work, we propose a series of solutions and methods to achieve conﬁdentiality with end-to-end guarantees, by using group-based keys within the context of a clustered and distributed key management framework. We have implemented such solutions on top of TinyOS, and assessed their achievable quality by means of the TOSSIM simulator.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that integrates a variety of heterogeneous nodes, such as connected devices (sensors, robots, smart phones ...), connected cars, smart homes, etc. These smart objects communicate and collaborate in distributed and dynamic environments that are facing several security challenges. Trust management is one of the most important challenges in IoT. Existing trust management solutions do not meet the new requirements of IoT such as heterogeneity, mobility and scalability. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical and scalable blockchain-based trust management protocol with mobility support in massively distributed IoT systems. In our protocol, mobile smart objects disseminate trust information on service providers to the blockchain. Thus, all the objects will have a global view on each service provider in the architecture, which speeds up the trust evaluation process. In addition, our protocol is resilient against the most known malicious attacks such as bad-mouthing, ballot-stufﬁng and cooperative attacks. We conﬁrm the efﬁciency of our proposal through theoretical analysis and extensive simulations. Finally, we show that it outperforms existing solutions especially in terms of scalability, mobility support, communication and computation costs.},

	abstract = {Many applications for ad hoc networks are based on a point-to-multipoint (multicast) communication paradigm, where a single source sends common data to many receivers, or, inversely, on a multipoint-to-point communication paradigm, where multiple sources send data to a single receiver. In such scenarios, communication can be secured by adopting a common secret key, denoted as ‘‘group key’’, shared by multiple communication endpoints. In this work, we propose a novel centralized approach to efﬁciently distribute and manage a group key in generic ad hoc networks and Internet of Things, while reducing the computational overhead and network trafﬁc due to group membership changes caused by users’ joins and leaves. In particular, the proposed protocol takes advantage of two possible leave strategies: (i) at a pre-determined time selected when the user joins the group or (ii) at an unpredictable time, as in the case of membership revocation. The proposed protocol is applied to two following relevant scenarios: (i) secure data aggregation in Internet of Things (IoT) and (ii) Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs).},

	abstract = {Since the start of Bitcoin in 2008[1], blockchain technology emerged as the next revolutionary technology. Though blockchain started off as a core technology of Bitcoin, its use cases are expanding to many other areas including finances, Internet of Things (IoT), security and such[2]. Currently, many private and public sectors are diving into the technology[3]. Aside from that, as software and hardware improve, we would see the beginning of IoT. And those IoT devices need to communicate and synchronize with each other. But in situations where more than thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices connected, we expect that using current model of server-client may have some limitations and issues while in synchronization. So, we propose using blockchain to build IoT system. Using blockchain, we can control and configure IoT devices. We manage keys using RSA public key cryptosystems where public keys are stored in Ethereum and private keys are saved on individual devices. Specifically, we choose Ethereum as our blockchain platform because using its smart contract, we can write our own Turing-complete code to run on top of Ethereum. Thus, we can easily manage configuration of IoT devices and build key management system. Even though we can simply use account as a key management system, which most of blockchain platform supports, we decide to use Ethereum because we can manage the system in a more fine-grained way. For the proof of a concept, we use a few IoT devices instead of a full system of IoT system, which consists of thousands of IoT devices. But in our later study, we would like to build a fully scaled IoT system using blockchain.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) bears unprecedented security and scalability challenges due to the magnitude of data produced and exchanged by IoT devices and platforms. Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by coupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchainbacked IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a “data marketplace” by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle ﬁnancial transaction and providing “by design” remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special ﬂavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.},
