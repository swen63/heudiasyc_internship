\begin{abstract}
  Despite the large deployment of IoT devices during recent years, IoT networks privacy and security remains a major concern for users. With IoT networks reaching all aspects of our daily life, IoT security came under highlight more than ever.
  
  Researchers affiliated with the \emph{Heudiasyc laboratory UMR CNRS 7153} developed the Multi Group Key Management protocol (MGKMP), in order to ensure messages exchange security within IoT networks. This end-of-study internship is mainly a furtherance of previous research activities conducted at the host organization.
  
  The research internship main task was to further develop the MGKMP. In particular, it aims at solving issues related to the Key Manager (KM). A second minor task concerned working on IoT security as a practiced engineer rather than a researcher. These tasks were carried out with a certain level of success, and useful results could be produced.
