This report presents my work during this research internship. This would wouldn't have been achieved without the help of several people though.

I would first like to thank my referent teacher \textbf{Pr. Pascal BERTHOME} for his support and assistance with my application from the very start. The internship wouldn't have taken place without him.

I want also to thank my supervisors \textbf{Dr. Hicham LAKLHLEF} and \textbf{Pr. Abdelmadjid BOUABDALLAH} for offering me this opportunity. They provided me with their guidance and wise advice all along the internship.
