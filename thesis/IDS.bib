	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are made up of number of tiny mobile nodes, which have the capability of computation, sensing and wireless network communication. The energy efficiency of each node in such kind of networks is one of the important issues under consideration. Thus for these networks, sensor nodes life time is basically depends on use of routing protocols for routing operations in WSN. There are various routing protocols proposed by different researchers, which are considered as efficient on the basis of performance of network lifetime and energy scavenging. There are different routing protocols introduced for WSN such as flat routing protocols, clustering routing protocols, hierarchical routing protocols etc. On the other hand, there are basically two types of WSNs, homogeneous and heterogeneous sensor networks. As WSN is vulnerable to different types of security threats, there are many security methods presented with their own advantages and disadvantages. Most of security methods are applied only on homogeneous WSN, but recently some methods were presented to provide the routing security in heterogeneous WSNs as well. In this paper, the different security threats and Intrusions in WSNs are presented, with review of different security methods.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is of practical interest in many applications such as detecting an intruder in a battlefield. The intrusion detection is defined as a mechanism for a WSN to detect the existence of inappropriate, incorrect, or anomalous moving attackers. For this purpose, it is a fundamental issue to characterize the WSN parameters such as node density and sensing range in terms of a desirable detection probability. In this paper, we consider this issue according to two WSN models: homogeneous and heterogeneous WSN. Furthermore, we derive the detection probability by considering two sensing models: single-sensing detection and multiple-sensing detection. In addition, we discuss the network connectivity and broadcast reachability, which are necessary conditions to ensure the corresponding detection probability in a WSN. Our simulation results validate the analytical values for both homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs.},

	abstract = {Intrusion detection system in wireless sensor network is one of the growing research areas in recent years. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of tiny devices. These tiny devices have limited energy, computational power, transmission range and memory. However, wireless sensor networks are deployed mostly in open and unguarded environment. Therefore, intrusion detection is one of the important aspects for wireless sensor networks. There are two different kind of intrusion detection mechanism: anomaly based and signature based. In this paper, we mention several attacks on WSN and we primarily focus only on the anomaly based intrusion detection system. Finally, we discuss about several existing approaches to describe how they have identified security threats and implemented their intrusion detection system.},

	abstract = {We propose a highly scalable cluster-based hierarchical trust management protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to effectively deal with selﬁsh or malicious nodes. Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield “ground truth” node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by ﬂooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.},
