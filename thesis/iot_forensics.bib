	abstract = {Security issues, threats, and attacks in relation with the IoT have been identified as promising and challenging area of research. Eventually, the need for a forensics methodology for investigating IoT-related crime is therefore essential. However, the IoT poses many challenges for forensics investigators. These include the wide range and variety of information, the unclear lines of differentiation between networks, for example private networks increasingly fading into public networks. Further, integration of a large number of objects in IoT forensic interest, along with the relevance of identified and collected devices makes forensic of IoT devices more complicated. The scope of this paper is to present a framework for IoT forensic. We aimed at the study and development of the link to support digital investigations of IoT devices and tackle emerging challenges in digital forensics. We emphasize on various steps for digital forensic with respect to IoT devices.},

	abstract = {Today is the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). The recent advances in hardware and information technology have accelerated the deployment of billions of interconnected, smart and adaptive devices in critical infrastructures like health, transportation, environmental control, and home automation. Transferring data over a network without requiring any kind of human-to-computer or human-to-human interaction, brings reliability and convenience to consumers, but also opens a new world of opportunity for intruders, and introduces a whole set of unique and complicated questions to the ﬁeld of Digital Forensics. Although IoT data could be a rich source of evidence, forensics professionals cope with diverse problems, starting from the huge variety of IoT devices and non-standard formats, to the multitenant cloud infrastructure and the resulting multi-jurisdictional litigations. A further challenge is the end-to-end encryption which represents a trade-off between users’ right to privacy and the success of the forensics investigation. Due to its volatile nature, digital evidence has to be acquired and analyzed using validated tools and techniques that ensure the maintenance of the Chain of Custody. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the main issues involved in the complex process of IoT-based investigations, particularly all legal, privacy and cloud security challenges. Furthermore, this work provides an overview of the past and current theoretical models in the digital forensics science. Special attention is paid to frameworks that aim to extract data in a privacy-preserving manner or secure the evidence integrity using decentralized blockchain-based solutions. In addition, the present paper addresses the ongoing Forensics-as-aService (FaaS) paradigm, as well as some promising cross-cutting data reduction and forensics intelligence techniques. Finally, several other research trends and open issues are presented, with emphasis on the need for proactive Forensics Readiness strategies and generally agreed-upon standards.},

	abstract = {Besides its enormous benefits to the industry and community the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced unique security challenges to its enablers and adopters. As the trend in cybersecurity threats continue to grow, it is likely to influence IoT deployments. Therefore it is eminent that besides strengthening the security of IoT systems we develop effective digital forensics techniques that when breaches occur we can track the sources of attacks and bring perpetrators to the due process with reliable digital evidence. The biggest challenge in this regard is the heterogeneous nature of devices in IoT systems and lack of unified standards. In this paper we investigate digital forensics from IoT perspectives. We argue that besides traditional digital forensics practices it is important to have application-specific forensics in place to ensure collection of evidence in context of specific IoT applications. We consider top three IoT applications and introduce a model which deals with not just traditional forensics but is applicable in digital as well as application-specific forensics process. We believe that the proposed model will enable collection, examination, analysis and reporting of forensically sound evidence in an IoT applicationspecific digital forensics investigation.},

While IoT opens new opportunities in various ﬁelds, it introduces new challenges in the ﬁeld of digital forensics investigations. The existing tools and procedures of digital forensics cannot meet the highly distributed and heterogeneous infrastructure of the IoT. Forensics investigators will face challenges while identifying necessary pieces of evidence from the IoT environment, and collecting and analyzing those evidence. In this article, we propose the ﬁrst working deﬁnition of IoT forensics and systematically analyze the IoT forensics domain to explore the challenges and issues in this special branch of digital forensics.
