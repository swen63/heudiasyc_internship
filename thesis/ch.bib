	abstract = {The wireless sensor networks have long been an attractive field to the researchers and scientists for its ease in deployment and maintenance. In this research, we focus on the maximization of network lifetime which has become a critical issue in sensor networks. Clustered organization of nodes with aggregation of data at the cluster head becomes one of the significant means to extend life expectancy of the network. This paper proposes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach for generating energy-aware clusters by optimal selection of cluster heads. The PSO eventually reduces the cost of locating optimal position for the head nodes in a cluster. In addition, we have implemented the PSO-based approach within the cluster rather than base station, which makes it a semi-distributed method. The selection criteria of the objective function are based on the residual energy, intra-cluster distance, node degree and head count of the probable cluster heads. Furthermore, influence of the expected number of packet retransmissions along the estimated path towards the cluster head is also reflected in our proposed energy consumption model. The performance evaluation of our proposed technique is carried out with respect to the well-known cluster-based sensor network protocols, LEACH-C and PSO-C respectively. Finally, the simulation clarifies the effectiveness of our proposed work over its comparatives in terms of network lifetime, average packet transmissions, cluster head selection rounds supported by PSO and average energy consumption.},

Experimental results show that this method balances the network node energy in two phases compared with the existed algorithms. The network lifetime is increased by 50\%, higher than that of low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), and increased by 30\%, higher than that of distribute energy-efﬁcient clustering algorithm (DEEC); also the survival time of the network is longer than that of energy-balanced deterministic clustering algorithm and adaptive energy optimized clustering algorithm, achieving the effectiveness of the network energy consumption, and it has the longest network lifetime.},

	abstract = {In wireless sensor network, a large number of sensor nodes are distributed to cover a certain area. Sensor node is little in size with restricted processing power, memory, and limited battery life. Because of restricted battery power, wireless sensor network needs to broaden the system lifetime by reducing the energy consumption. A clustering‐based protocols adapt the use of energy by giving a balance to all nodes to become a cluster head. In this paper, we concentrate on a recent hierarchical routing protocols, which are depending on LEACH protocol to enhance its performance and increase the lifetime of wireless sensor network. So our enhanced protocol called Node Ranked–LEACH is proposed. Our proposed protocol improves the total network lifetime based on node rank algorithm. Node rank algorithm depends on both path cost and number of links between nodes to select the cluster head of each cluster. This enhancement reflects the real weight of specific node to success and can be represented as a cluster head. The proposed algorithm overcomes the random process selection, which leads to unexpected fail for some cluster heads in other LEACH versions, and it gives a good performance in the network lifetime and energy consumption comparing with previous version of LEACH protocols.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSN) groups specialized transducers that provide sensing services to Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited energy and storage resources. Since replacement or recharging of batteries in sensor nodes is almost impossible, power consumption becomes one of the crucial design issues in WSN. Clustering algorithm plays an important role in power conservation for the energy constrained network. Choosing a cluster head can appropriately balance the load in the network thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing lifetime. The paper focuses on an efficient cluster head election scheme that rotates the cluster head position among the nodes with higher energy level as compared to other. The algorithm considers initial energy, residual energy and an optimum value of cluster heads to elect the next group of cluster heads for the network that suits for IoT applications such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and systems. Simulation analysis shows the modified version performs better than the LEACH protocol by enhancing the throughput by 60\%, lifetime by 66\%, and residual energy by 64\%.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in wireless sensor networks have led to many new protocols specifically designed for sensor networks where energy awareness is an essential consideration. Clustering is a key routing technique used to reduce energy consumption. Clustering sensors into groups, so that sensors communicate information only to clusterheads and then the cluster-heads communicate the aggregated information to the base station, saves energy and thus prolonging network lifetime. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient cluster-head selection algorithm for adapting clusters and rotating cluster head positions to evenly distribute the energy load among all the nodes. Our proposed model is extended to the LEACH’s stochastic cluster-head selection algorithm by modifying the probability of each node to become cluster-head based on remaining energy level of sensor nodes for transmission. Simulation results show that our proposed model could better implement load balance and prolong the lifetime of the network.},

	abstract = {Wireless distributed microsensor systems will enable the reliable monitoring of a variety of environments for both civil and military applications. In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have signiﬁcant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our ﬁndings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multihop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.},
