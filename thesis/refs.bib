	abstract = {The wireless sensor networks have long been an attractive field to the researchers and scientists for its ease in deployment and maintenance. In this research, we focus on the maximization of network lifetime which has become a critical issue in sensor networks. Clustered organization of nodes with aggregation of data at the cluster head becomes one of the significant means to extend life expectancy of the network. This paper proposes Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach for generating energy-aware clusters by optimal selection of cluster heads. The PSO eventually reduces the cost of locating optimal position for the head nodes in a cluster. In addition, we have implemented the PSO-based approach within the cluster rather than base station, which makes it a semi-distributed method. The selection criteria of the objective function are based on the residual energy, intra-cluster distance, node degree and head count of the probable cluster heads. Furthermore, influence of the expected number of packet retransmissions along the estimated path towards the cluster head is also reflected in our proposed energy consumption model. The performance evaluation of our proposed technique is carried out with respect to the well-known cluster-based sensor network protocols, LEACH-C and PSO-C respectively. Finally, the simulation clarifies the effectiveness of our proposed work over its comparatives in terms of network lifetime, average packet transmissions, cluster head selection rounds supported by PSO and average energy consumption.},

The network lifetime is increased by 50\%, higher than that of low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), and increased by 30\%, higher than that of distribute energy-efﬁcient clustering algorithm (DEEC); also the survival time of the network is longer than that of energy-balanced deterministic clustering algorithm and adaptive energy optimized clustering algorithm, achieving the effectiveness of the network energy consumption, and it has the longest network lifetime.},

	abstract = {In wireless sensor network, a large number of sensor nodes are distributed to cover a certain area. Sensor node is little in size with restricted processing power, memory, and limited battery life. Because of restricted battery power, wireless sensor network needs to broaden the system lifetime by reducing the energy consumption. A clustering‐based protocols adapt the use of energy by giving a balance to all nodes to become a cluster head. In this paper, we concentrate on a recent hierarchical routing protocols, which are depending on LEACH protocol to enhance its performance and increase the lifetime of wireless sensor network. So our enhanced protocol called Node Ranked–LEACH is proposed. Our proposed protocol improves the total network lifetime based on node rank algorithm. Node rank algorithm depends on both path cost and number of links between nodes to select the cluster head of each cluster. This enhancement reflects the real weight of specific node to success and can be represented as a cluster head. The proposed algorithm overcomes the random process selection, which leads to unexpected fail for some cluster heads in other LEACH versions, and it gives a good performance in the network lifetime and energy consumption comparing with previous version of LEACH protocols.},

Since replacement or recharging of batteries in sensor nodes is almost impossible, power consumption becomes one of the crucial design issues in WSN. Clustering algorithm plays an important role in power conservation for the energy constrained network. Choosing a cluster head can appropriately balance the load in the network thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing lifetime. The paper focuses on an efficient cluster head election scheme that rotates the cluster head position among the nodes with higher energy level as compared to other. The algorithm considers initial energy, residual energy and an optimum value of cluster heads to elect the next group of cluster heads for the network that suits for IoT applications such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, and systems. Simulation analysis shows the modified version performs better than the LEACH protocol by enhancing the throughput by 60\%, lifetime by 66\%, and residual energy by 64\%.},

Clustering is a key routing technique used to reduce energy consumption. Clustering sensors into groups, so that sensors communicate information only to clusterheads and then the cluster-heads communicate the aggregated information to the base station, saves energy and thus prolonging network lifetime. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient cluster-head selection algorithm for adapting clusters and rotating cluster head positions to evenly distribute the energy load among all the nodes. Our proposed model is extended to the LEACH’s stochastic cluster-head selection algorithm by modifying the probability of each node to become cluster-head based on remaining energy level of sensor nodes for transmission.

In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have signiﬁcant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our ﬁndings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multihop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.},

	abstract = {IoT Consist of interrelated devices such as digital devices, mechanical devices, computer system, sensors, etc. for transceiving the information over the network. The scalability is essential to enhance the energy utilization and the performance of the environment, while mobility enhances the coverage of the system. Key management is vital for encrypted information transmitted over the network. Although many key management techniques are available, still it is a challenging issue concerning energy and computational cost, so robust key management technique is required that guarantees the required security requirements. In this paper, we proposed a cognitive key management technique (CKMT). The CKMT mechanism is helpful for key management and maintenance in a cluster-based mobile environment that reduces the rekeying process which is required for the mobile node when it enters the new location area, thereby reducing the computational overhead and enhances the scalability to large size network which makes our scheme more robust because strong key management technique is important while providing security services. Initially, we form a cluster, then Cluster-Head (CH) will be elected, it’s a coordinator node that acts as a key manager. We also made an assumption that the sensors and Cluster-Heads are mobile, they can be able to shift from one position to another. This CH oversees and keeps up the private keys of sensors. When CH changes its location, it will hand over its responsibilities to the other CH in the network for uninterrupted communication. Our scheme uses local keys and foreign keys for each node and pairwise key is used only for the common nodes among the cluster so our scheme reduces the computational cost in the network under mobility condition. The results show that our proposed algorithm lowers the overhead in terms of computational costs, energy consumption, and delay.},

These applications and many other ones imply several non-functional requirements to be satisﬁed by the adopted IoT solution, where security assumes paramount importance. Secure communications among the IoT nodes are strongly needed due to the use of wireless technologies that are easy to eavesdrop, in order to steal valuable information.

	abstract = {Many applications for ad hoc networks are based on a point-to-multipoint (multicast) communication paradigm, where a single source sends common data to many receivers, or, inversely, on a multipoint-to-point communication paradigm, where multiple sources send data to a single receiver. In such scenarios, communication can be secured by adopting a common secret key, denoted as ‘‘group key’’, shared by multiple communication endpoints. In this work, we propose a novel centralized approach to efﬁciently distribute and manage a group key in generic ad hoc networks and Internet of Things, while reducing the computational overhead and network trafﬁc due to group membership changes caused by users’ joins and leaves. In particular, the proposed protocol takes advantage of two possible leave strategies: (i) at a pre-determined time selected when the user joins the group or (ii) at an unpredictable time, as in the case of membership revocation. The proposed protocol is applied to two following relevant scenarios: (i) secure data aggregation in Internet of Things (IoT) and (ii) Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs).},

	abstract = {Since the start of Bitcoin in 2008[1], blockchain technology emerged as the next revolutionary technology. Though blockchain started off as a core technology of Bitcoin, its use cases are expanding to many other areas including finances, Internet of Things (IoT), security and such[2]. Currently, many private and public sectors are diving into the technology[3]. Aside from that, as software and hardware improve, we would see the beginning of IoT. And those IoT devices need to communicate and synchronize with each other. But in situations where more than thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices connected, we expect that using current model of server-client may have some limitations and issues while in synchronization. So, we propose using blockchain to build IoT system. Using blockchain, we can control and configure IoT devices. We manage keys using RSA public key cryptosystems where public keys are stored in Ethereum and private keys are saved on individual devices. Specifically, we choose Ethereum as our blockchain platform because using its smart contract, we can write our own Turing-complete code to run on top of Ethereum. Thus, we can easily manage configuration of IoT devices and build key management system. Even though we can simply use account as a key management system, which most of blockchain platform supports, we decide to use Ethereum because we can manage the system in a more fine-grained way. For the proof of a concept, we use a few IoT devices instead of a full system of IoT system, which consists of thousands of IoT devices. But in our later study, we would like to build a fully scaled IoT system using blockchain.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) bears unprecedented security and scalability challenges due to the magnitude of data produced and exchanged by IoT devices and platforms. Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by coupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchainbacked IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a “data marketplace” by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle ﬁnancial transaction and providing “by design” remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special ﬂavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.},

The energy efficiency of each node in such kind of networks is one of the important issues under consideration. Thus for these networks, sensor nodes life time is basically depends on use of routing protocols for routing operations in WSN. There are various routing protocols proposed by different researchers, which are considered as efficient on the basis of performance of network lifetime and energy scavenging. There are different routing protocols introduced for WSN such as flat routing protocols, clustering routing protocols, hierarchical routing protocols etc. On the other hand, there are basically two types of WSNs, homogeneous and heterogeneous sensor networks. As WSN is vulnerable to different types of security threats, there are many security methods presented with their own advantages and disadvantages. Most of security methods are applied only on homogeneous WSN, but recently some methods were presented to provide the routing security in heterogeneous WSNs as well. In this paper, the different security threats and Intrusions in WSNs are presented, with review of different security methods.},

The intrusion detection is defined as a mechanism for a WSN to detect the existence of inappropriate, incorrect, or anomalous moving attackers. For this purpose, it is a fundamental issue to characterize the WSN parameters such as node density and sensing range in terms of a desirable detection probability. In this paper, we consider this issue according to two WSN models: homogeneous and heterogeneous WSN. Furthermore, we derive the detection probability by considering two sensing models: single-sensing detection and multiple-sensing detection. In addition, we discuss the network connectivity and broadcast reachability, which are necessary conditions to ensure the corresponding detection probability in a WSN.

Unlike prior work, we consider multidimensional trust attributes derived from communication and social networks to evaluate the overall trust of a sensor node. By means of a novel probability model, we describe a heterogeneous WSN comprising a large number of sensor nodes with vastly different social and quality of service (QoS) behaviors with the objective to yield “ground truth” node status. This serves as a basis for validating our protocol design by comparing subjective trust generated as a result of protocol execution at runtime against objective trust obtained from actual node status. To demonstrate the utility of our hierarchical trust management protocol, we apply it to trust-based geographic routing and trust-based intrusion detection. For each application, we identify the best trust composition and formation to maximize application performance. Our results indicate that trust-based geographic routing approaches the ideal performance level achievable by ﬂooding-based routing in message delivery ratio and message delay without incurring substantial message overhead. For trust-based intrusion detection, we discover that there exists an optimal trust threshold for minimizing false positives and false negatives. Furthermore, trust-based intrusion detection outperforms traditional anomaly-based intrusion detection approaches in both the detection probability and the false positive probability.},

The recent advances in hardware and information technology have accelerated the deployment of billions of interconnected, smart and adaptive devices in critical infrastructures like health, transportation, environmental control, and home automation. Transferring data over a network without requiring any kind of human-to-computer or human-to-human interaction, brings reliability and convenience to consumers, but also opens a new world of opportunity for intruders, and introduces a whole set of unique and complicated questions to the ﬁeld of Digital Forensics. Although IoT data could be a rich source of evidence, forensics professionals cope with diverse problems, starting from the huge variety of IoT devices and non-standard formats, to the multitenant cloud infrastructure and the resulting multi-jurisdictional litigations. A further challenge is the end-to-end encryption which represents a trade-off between users’ right to privacy and the success of the forensics investigation. Due to its volatile nature, digital evidence has to be acquired and analyzed using validated tools and techniques that ensure the maintenance of the Chain of Custody. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify and discuss the main issues involved in the complex process of IoT-based investigations, particularly all legal, privacy and cloud security challenges. Furthermore, this work provides an overview of the past and current theoretical models in the digital forensics science. Special attention is paid to frameworks that aim to extract data in a privacy-preserving manner or secure the evidence integrity using decentralized blockchain-based solutions. In addition, the present paper addresses the ongoing Forensics-as-aService (FaaS) paradigm, as well as some promising cross-cutting data reduction and forensics intelligence techniques.

As the trend in cybersecurity threats continue to grow, it is likely to influence IoT deployments. Therefore it is eminent that besides strengthening the security of IoT systems we develop effective digital forensics techniques that when breaches occur we can track the sources of attacks and bring perpetrators to the due process with reliable digital evidence. The biggest challenge in this regard is the heterogeneous nature of devices in IoT systems and lack of unified standards. In this paper we investigate digital forensics from IoT perspectives. We argue that besides traditional digital forensics practices it is important to have application-specific forensics in place to ensure collection of evidence in context of specific IoT applications. We consider top three IoT applications and introduce a model which deals with not just traditional forensics but is applicable in digital as well as application-specific forensics process. We believe that the proposed model will enable collection, examination, analysis and reporting of forensically sound evidence in an IoT applicationspecific digital forensics investigation.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network made up of a large number of devices that collaborate to provide various service for the beneﬁt of society. Two communication modes are required to enable a smooth collaboration. A device can send the same message to several other ones participating in the same service. It may also address a speciﬁc device in a Peer-to-Peer manner. The ﬁrst mode of communication is called Group Communication, while we refer to the second as Device-to-Device Communication. One of the main challenges facing the IoT is how to secure these two modes of communication. Among all the security issues, the Key Management is one of the most challenging. This is mainly due to the fact that most of the IoT devices have limited resources in terms of storage, calculation, communication and energy. Although diﬀerent approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem, each of them presents its own limitations and weaknesses. Moreover, they usually consider either the Group or the Device-to-Device Communication. In this paper, we propose a novel versatile Key Management protocol for the Internet of Things. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst protocol that secures both modes of communication at the same time. We then analyze the security and performance of our solution and compare it to the existing schemes. For Group Communication, we show that our solution ensures the forward and backward secrecy and, unlike most of the existing Group Key Management protocols, guarantees the secure coexistence of several services in the network. With regard to Device-to-Device Communication, we prove that our solution is ﬂexible and provides a good level of resilience and network connectivity compared to the existing Peer-to-Peer Key Management schemes. We ﬁnally demonstrate that, by balancing the loads between the heterogeneous devices according to their capabilities, our solution is both eﬃcient and scalable.},

One of the main challenges facing the IoT is how to secure communication between these devices. Among all the issues, the Group Key Management is one of the most difﬁcult. Although different approaches have been proposed to solve it, most of them use the same security parameters to secure all communications.

Moreover, the compromise of a member will jeopardize all services.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network made up of a large number of devices which are able to automatically communicate to computer systems, people and each other providing various services for the beneﬁt of society. These devices have the particularity of being heterogeneous and so have different capabilities in terms of storage, computing, communication and energy. One of the main challenges facing the IoT is how to secure communication between these heterogeneous devices. Among all the issues, the Group Key Management is one of the most difﬁcult. Although different approaches have been proposed to solve it, very few of them consider the heterogeneous nature of the IoT. We propose then a highly scalable Multi-Group Key Management protocol for IoT that ensures the forward and backward secrecy, efﬁciently recovers from collusion attacks, guarantees the secure coexistence of several services in a single network and balances the loads between its heterogeneous devices according to their capabilities. The evaluation of our solution shows that it is efﬁcient for large-scale heterogeneous networks even if they contain highly resource-constrained devices.},

First, it rekeys the group with only two messages, introducing an overhead which is small, constant, and independent of the group size. Second, GREP considers collusion as a ﬁrst-class attack. Third, GREP efﬁciently recovers the group from a collusion attack without recourse to a total member reinitialization. The recovery cost smoothly grows with the group size, and gradually increases with the attack severity. GREP achieves these results by organizing nodes into logical subgroups and exploiting the history of node joining events. This allows GREP to establish a total ordering among subgroups and among nodes in each subgroup, so making collusion recovery highly scalable and efﬁcient. We evaluate performance from several standpoints, and show that GREP is deployable in large-scale networks of customary, even resource constrained, platforms.},

	abstract = {Many key management schemes were proposed for protecting wireless sensor networks (WSNs). While applying key management to the network, it is important to ensure that the eﬃciency of the network is not greatly aﬀected by key connectivity. Poor connectivity might lead to many messages forwarding. Consequently, a large amount of energy of the involved nodes would be consumed during message forwarding, which is not suitable for the resources-constraint sensor nodes. In this work, we analyze the impact of key connectivity on the eﬃciency of communication. Then, a novel key generation method based on system of equations is proposed to improve key connectivity of key management. The involved equations are applied to establish secret keys and each node uses these keys for protecting their communication. The system of equations is constructed to have one and only one solution so that the unique solution can also be used to establish a shared hidden key for enhancing the association among nodes. As a result, neighbors can directly communicate with each other through the shared hidden key even though they do not have common keys. To diﬀerentiate from normal keys, keys generated by the proposed method are called associated-keys. According to the analyses, we recommend that systems of linear equations (linear systems) instead of systems of polynomial equations are used to realize the proposed method with respect to the computation complexity. Furthermore, we illustrate that linear systems of two variables are suﬃcient to generate keys for large scale of networks. The Exclusion Basis System (EBS) is used as a instance to illustrate the implementation of key management with associated-keys. The theoretical analyses and simulation results show that key management schemes with associated-keys have better key connectivity than the corresponding schemes with normal keys. Meanwhile, other performance metrics are unaﬀected.},

CL-EKM supports efﬁcient key updates when a node leaves or joins a cluster and ensures forward and backward key secrecy. The protocol also supports efﬁcient key revocation for compromised nodes and minimizes the impact of a node compromise on the security of other communication links. A security analysis of our scheme shows that our protocol is effective in defending against various attacks. We implement CL-EKM in Contiki OS and simulate it using Cooja simulator to assess its time, energy, communication and memory performance.},

IP multicast by itself does not provide any mechanisms for preventing nongroup members to have access to the group communication.

Researchers have proposed several different approaches to group key management. These approaches can be divided into three main classes: centralized group key management protocols, decentralized architectures and distributed key management protocols. The three classes are described here and an insight given to their features and goals.

Our value added is their suitable integration into a security protocol exchange, designed at layer 2, in the 802.15.4 protocol stack, which permits to i) avoid Elliptic Point multiplications upon rekeying of previously paired devices, and ii) support mutual authentication while securing the protocol exchange. To prove its viability, the proposed Key Management Protocol has been implemented and assessed on severely constrained devices. As expected, but made explicit and quantiﬁed by our experimental performance evaluation, the usage of implicit certiﬁcates in conjunction with an optimized message exchange yields impressive gains in terms of airtime consumption with respect to state of the art schemes.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices that collect sensitive data, access control is more crucial than ever to safeguard IoT data from unauthorized use. To enforce access control policies without trusted online entity, one promising approach is to maintain a group key shared between a device and its current subscribers, such that the device can encrypt its data and only the subscribers can decrypt it. However, prior group key management (GKM) schemes fail to efﬁciently address new challenges introduced by the massive scale of IoT devices, dynamic memberships of users, and changes in the number of devices. This paper explores efﬁcient GKM to accommodate multiple devices (in addition to multiple users) and to handle frequent membership and device number changes. Inspired by the observation that devices with similar functionalities often have similar access permissions, we propose a two-tier GKM architecture called GROUPIT, in which each device is assigned to one of many predeﬁned groups, and key management is performed within each group as well as between groups to improve efﬁciency. Despite being conceptually simple, GROUPIT addresses technical challenges including: 1) preventing a malicious device from obtaining extra information about other devices in the same group and 2) ensuring forward/backward secrecy and preventing collusion attacks when gluing two existing GKMs together. The probability of a successful collusion attack quickly drops to 0.3\% after ﬁve membership changes even in a small device group (e.g., 8). This paper provides both theoretical analysis and a proof-of-concept implementation based on Alljoyn, an opensource IoT communication framework to demonstrate the feasibility of GROUPIT.},

However, existing key management protocols are not directly applicable on IoT due, among other things, to severe and high resource constraints of some devices that make up the IoT network. Therefore, it is necessary that the proposed key management protocols takes in charge these features and constraints. Most existing solutions didn’t focus on optimizing, at the same time, all performance criteria, like communication, computation and storage. Some of them put special emphasis on minimizing one criteria but ignore the others. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight matrix based key management protocol for Iot network, which is not only ﬂexible, scalable and resilient to many types of attacks, but also can reduce the communication, computation and storage overheads at constrained nodes side. The security properties like authentication, integrity and secrecy have been checked by using the formal veriﬁcation tool AVISPA. Moreover, security and performance analysis show that our scheme protects user’s sensitive data from several types of attacks by achieving secure end-to-end communications, and optimizes the energy consumption, which is suitable for resource-limited networks.},

As attackers shift their targets towards IoT devices, malware has been developed to compromise IoT devices equipped with different CPU architectures. While malware detection has been a well-studied area for desktop PCs, heterogeneous processor architecture in IoT devices brings in unique challenges. Existing approaches utilize static or dynamic binary analysis for identifying malware characteristics, but they all fall short when dealing with IoT malware compiled for different architectures. In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient signature generation method for IoT malware, which generates distinguishable signatures based on high-level structural, statistical and string feature vectors, as high-level features are more robust against code variations across different architectures. The generated signatures for each malware family can be used for developing lightweight malware detection tools to secure IoT devices. Extensive experiments with two datasets of 5,150 recent IoT malware samples show that our scheme can achieve 95.5\% detection rate with 0\% false positive rate. Moreover, the proposed scheme can achieve 85.2\% detection rate in detecting novel IoT malware.},

	abstract = {Most of malware detectors are based on syntactic signatures that identify known malicious programs. Up to now this architecture has been sufﬁciently efﬁcient to overcome most of malware attacks. Nevertheless, the complexity of malicious codes still increase. As a result the time required to reverse engineer malicious programs and to forge new signatures is increasingly longer. This study proposes an efﬁcient construction of a morphological malware detector, that is a detector which associates syntactic and semantic analysis. It aims at facilitating the task of malware analysts providing some abstraction on the signature representation which is based on control ﬂow graphs. We build an efﬁcient signature matching engine over tree automata techniques. Moreover we describe a generic graph rewriting engine in order to deal with classic mutations techniques. Finally, we provide a preliminary evaluation of the strategy detection carrying out experiments on a malware collection.},

	abstract = {Key establishment in sensor networks is a challenging problem because of resource constraints of the sensors. The classical public-key routines are impractical in most sensor network architectures. In this paper, we propose a new random key pre-distribution scheme which is based on the identity-based approach for key establishment between two neighbor nodes in wireless sensor networks. Our proposed scheme provides better security against node capture, in particular, against node fabrication attack than the existing random key pre-distribution schemes. Moreover, our scheme has better trade-oﬀ between communication overhead, network connectivity and security against node capture compared to the existing random key pre-distribution schemes. In addition, our scheme supports dynamic node addition after initial deployment and also works for any deployment conﬁguration.},

We present three new mechanisms for key establishment using the framework of pre-distributing a random set of keys to each node. First, in the q-composite keys scheme, we trade off the unlikeliness of a large-scale network attack in order to signiﬁcantly strengthen random key predistribution’s strength against smaller-scale attacks. Second, in the multipath-reinforcement scheme, we show how to strengthen the security between any two nodes by leveraging the security of other links. Finally, we present the random-pairwise keys scheme, which perfectly preserves the secrecy of the rest of the network when any node is captured, and also enables node-to-node authentication and quorum-based revocation.},

To solve this problem, we propose a secure random key distribution (SRKD) scheme, which provides a new method for the defense against the attack. Speciﬁcally, we combine a localized algorithm with a voting mechanism to support the detection and revocation of malicious nodes. We further change the meaning of the parameter s to help prevent the replication attack. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the detection ratio of replicate nodes exceeds 90\% when the number of network nodes reaches 200, which demonstrates the security and effectiveness of our scheme. Compared with existing state-of-the-art schemes, the SRKD scheme also has good storage and communication efﬁciency.},

It has been widely used in industrial production and social applications including smart home, healthcare, and industrial automation. While bringing unprecedented convenience, accessibility, and efﬁciency, IoT has caused acute security and privacy threats in recent years. There are increasing research works to ease these threats, but many problems remain open. To better understand the essential reasons of new IoT threats and the challenges in current research, this survey ﬁrst proposes the concept of “IoT features.” Then, we discuss the security and privacy effects of eight IoT features including the threats they cause, existing solutions to threats and research challenges yet to be solved. To help researchers follow the up-to-date works in this ﬁeld, this paper ﬁnally illustrates the developing trend of IoT security research and reveals how IoT features affect existing security research by investigating most existing research works related to IoT security from 2013 to 2017.},

The Internet of Things is, thus, the evolution of the Internet to cover the real world, enabling many new services that will improve people’s everyday lives, spawn new businesses, and make buildings, cities, and transport smarter. Smart things allow indeed for ubiquitous data collection or tracking, but these useful features are also examples of privacy threats that are already now limiting the success of the Internet of Things vision when not implemented correctly. These threats involve new challenges such as the pervasive privacy-aware management of personal data or methods to control or avoid ubiquitous tracking and proﬁling. This paper analyzes the privacy issues in the Internet of Things in detail. To this end, we ﬁrst discuss the evolving features and trends in the Internet of Things with the goal of scrutinizing their privacy implications. Second, we classify and examine privacy threats in this new setting, pointing out the challenges that need to be overcome to ensure that the Internet of Things becomes a reality.

The success probability of our 22-step attack is 1 for both SHA-256 and SHA-512. The computational eﬀorts for the 23-step and 24step SHA-256 attacks are respectively 211.5 and 228.5 calls to the corresponding step reduced SHA-256. The corresponding values for the 23 and 24-step SHA-512 attack are respectively 216.5 and 232.5 calls. Using a look-up table having 232 (resp. 264) entries the computational eﬀort for ﬁnding 24-step SHA-256 (resp. SHA-512) collisions can be reduced to 215.5 (resp. 222.5) calls. We exhibit colliding message pairs for 22, 23 and 24-step SHA-256 and SHA-512. This is the ﬁrst time that a colliding message pair for 24-step SHA-512 is provided. The previous work on 23 and 24-step SHA-2 attacks is due to Indesteege et al. and utilizes the local collision presented by Nikoli´c and Biryukov (NB) at FSE ’08. The reported computational eﬀorts are 218 and 228.5 for 23 and 24-step SHA-256 respectively and 243.9 and 253 for 23 and 24-step SHA-512. The previous 23 and 24-step attacks ﬁrst constructed a pseudo-collision and later converted it into a collision for the reduced round SHA-2 family. We show that this two step procedure is unnecessary. Although these attacks improve upon the existing reduced round SHA-2 attacks, they do not threaten the security of the full SHA-2 family.},
