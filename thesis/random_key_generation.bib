	abstract = {Key establishment in sensor networks is a challenging problem because of resource constraints of the sensors. The classical public-key routines are impractical in most sensor network architectures. In this paper, we propose a new random key pre-distribution scheme which is based on the identity-based approach for key establishment between two neighbor nodes in wireless sensor networks. Our proposed scheme provides better security against node capture, in particular, against node fabrication attack than the existing random key pre-distribution schemes. Moreover, our scheme has better trade-oﬀ between communication overhead, network connectivity and security against node capture compared to the existing random key pre-distribution schemes. In addition, our scheme supports dynamic node addition after initial deployment and also works for any deployment conﬁguration.},

	abstract = {Key establishment in sensor networks is a challenging problem because asymmetric key cryptosystems are unsuitable for use in resource constrained sensor nodes, and also because the nodes could be physically compromised by an adversary. We present three new mechanisms for key establishment using the framework of pre-distributing a random set of keys to each node. First, in the q-composite keys scheme, we trade off the unlikeliness of a large-scale network attack in order to signiﬁcantly strengthen random key predistribution’s strength against smaller-scale attacks. Second, in the multipath-reinforcement scheme, we show how to strengthen the security between any two nodes by leveraging the security of other links. Finally, we present the random-pairwise keys scheme, which perfectly preserves the secrecy of the rest of the network when any node is captured, and also enables node-to-node authentication and quorum-based revocation.},

	abstract = {With the wide deployment of wireless sensor networks in smart industrial systems, lots of unauthorized attacking from the adversary are greatly threatening the security and privacy of the entire industrial systems, of which node replication attacks can hardly be defended, since it is conducted in the physical layer. To solve this problem, we propose a secure random key distribution (SRKD) scheme, which provides a new method for the defense against the attack. Speciﬁcally, we combine a localized algorithm with a voting mechanism to support the detection and revocation of malicious nodes. We further change the meaning of the parameter s to help prevent the replication attack. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the detection ratio of replicate nodes exceeds 90\% when the number of network nodes reaches 200, which demonstrates the security and effectiveness of our scheme. Compared with existing state-of-the-art schemes, the SRKD scheme also has good storage and communication efﬁciency.},
