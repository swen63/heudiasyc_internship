	abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are increasingly targeted by adversaries due to their unique characteristics such as constant online connection, lack of protection, and full integration in people’s daily life. As attackers shift their targets towards IoT devices, malware has been developed to compromise IoT devices equipped with different CPU architectures. While malware detection has been a well-studied area for desktop PCs, heterogeneous processor architecture in IoT devices brings in unique challenges. Existing approaches utilize static or dynamic binary analysis for identifying malware characteristics, but they all fall short when dealing with IoT malware compiled for different architectures. In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient signature generation method for IoT malware, which generates distinguishable signatures based on high-level structural, statistical and string feature vectors, as high-level features are more robust against code variations across different architectures. The generated signatures for each malware family can be used for developing lightweight malware detection tools to secure IoT devices. Extensive experiments with two datasets of 5,150 recent IoT malware samples show that our scheme can achieve 95.5\% detection rate with 0\% false positive rate. Moreover, the proposed scheme can achieve 85.2\% detection rate in detecting novel IoT malware.},

	abstract = {The quantity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the marketplace and lack of security is staggering. The interconnectedness of IoT devices has increased the attack surface for hackers. “White Worm” technology has the potential to combat infiltrating malware. Before white worm technology becomes viable, its capabilities must be constrained to specific devices and limited to non-harmful actions. This paper addresses the current problem, international research, and the conflicting interest of individuals, businesses, and governments regarding white worm technology. Proposed is a new perspective on utilizing white worm technology to protect the vulnerability of IoT devices, while overcoming its challenges.},

	abstract = {Most of malware detectors are based on syntactic signatures that identify known malicious programs. Up to now this architecture has been sufﬁciently efﬁcient to overcome most of malware attacks. Nevertheless, the complexity of malicious codes still increase. As a result the time required to reverse engineer malicious programs and to forge new signatures is increasingly longer. This study proposes an efﬁcient construction of a morphological malware detector, that is a detector which associates syntactic and semantic analysis. It aims at facilitating the task of malware analysts providing some abstraction on the signature representation which is based on control ﬂow graphs. We build an efﬁcient signature matching engine over tree automata techniques. Moreover we describe a generic graph rewriting engine in order to deal with classic mutations techniques. Finally, we provide a preliminary evaluation of the strategy detection carrying out experiments on a malware collection.},
