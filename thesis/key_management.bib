	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network made up of a large number of devices that collaborate to provide various service for the beneﬁt of society. Two communication modes are required to enable a smooth collaboration. A device can send the same message to several other ones participating in the same service. It may also address a speciﬁc device in a Peer-to-Peer manner. The ﬁrst mode of communication is called Group Communication, while we refer to the second as Device-to-Device Communication. One of the main challenges facing the IoT is how to secure these two modes of communication. Among all the security issues, the Key Management is one of the most challenging. This is mainly due to the fact that most of the IoT devices have limited resources in terms of storage, calculation, communication and energy. Although diﬀerent approaches have been proposed to deal with this problem, each of them presents its own limitations and weaknesses. Moreover, they usually consider either the Group or the Device-to-Device Communication. In this paper, we propose a novel versatile Key Management protocol for the Internet of Things. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst protocol that secures both modes of communication at the same time. We then analyze the security and performance of our solution and compare it to the existing schemes. For Group Communication, we show that our solution ensures the forward and backward secrecy and, unlike most of the existing Group Key Management protocols, guarantees the secure coexistence of several services in the network. With regard to Device-to-Device Communication, we prove that our solution is ﬂexible and provides a good level of resilience and network connectivity compared to the existing Peer-to-Peer Key Management schemes. We ﬁnally demonstrate that, by balancing the loads between the heterogeneous devices according to their capabilities, our solution is both eﬃcient and scalable.},

One of the main challenges facing the IoT is how to secure communication between these devices. Among all the issues, the Group Key Management is one of the most difﬁcult. Although different approaches have been proposed to solve it, most of them use the same security parameters to secure all communications. Thus, if several services are provided by the network, communications within a service will be accessible to all network members even those which did not subscribe to it. Moreover, the compromise of a member will jeopardize all services.

First, it rekeys the group with only two messages, introducing an overhead which is small, constant, and independent of the group size. Second, GREP considers collusion as a ﬁrst-class attack. Third, GREP efﬁciently recovers the group from a collusion attack without recourse to a total member reinitialization. The recovery cost smoothly grows with the group size, and gradually increases with the attack severity. GREP achieves these results by organizing nodes into logical subgroups and exploiting the history of node joining events. This allows GREP to establish a total ordering among subgroups and among nodes in each subgroup, so making collusion recovery highly scalable and efﬁcient. We evaluate performance from several standpoints, and show that GREP is deployable in large-scale networks of customary, even resource constrained, platforms.},

This paper proposes a novel key predistribution scheme based on the polynomial pool-based key predistribution scheme and random key predistribution.

	abstract = {Many key management schemes were proposed for protecting wireless sensor networks (WSNs). While applying key management to the network, it is important to ensure that the eﬃciency of the network is not greatly aﬀected by key connectivity. Poor connectivity might lead to many messages forwarding. Consequently, a large amount of energy of the involved nodes would be consumed during message forwarding, which is not suitable for the resources-constraint sensor nodes. In this work, we analyze the impact of key connectivity on the eﬃciency of communication. Then, a novel key generation method based on system of equations is proposed to improve key connectivity of key management. The involved equations are applied to establish secret keys and each node uses these keys for protecting their communication. The system of equations is constructed to have one and only one solution so that the unique solution can also be used to establish a shared hidden key for enhancing the association among nodes. As a result, neighbors can directly communicate with each other through the shared hidden key even though they do not have common keys. To diﬀerentiate from normal keys, keys generated by the proposed method are called associated-keys. According to the analyses, we recommend that systems of linear equations (linear systems) instead of systems of polynomial equations are used to realize the proposed method with respect to the computation complexity. Furthermore, we illustrate that linear systems of two variables are suﬃcient to generate keys for large scale of networks. The Exclusion Basis System (EBS) is used as a instance to illustrate the implementation of key management with associated-keys. The theoretical analyses and simulation results show that key management schemes with associated-keys have better key connectivity than the corresponding schemes with normal keys. Meanwhile, other performance metrics are unaﬀected.},

The protocol also supports efﬁcient key revocation for compromised nodes and minimizes the impact of a node compromise on the security of other communication links. A security analysis of our scheme shows that our protocol is effective in defending against various attacks.

IP multicast by itself does not provide any mechanisms for preventing nongroup members to have access to the group communication. Although encryption can be used to protect messages exchanged among group members, distributing the cryptographic keys becomes an issue. Researchers have proposed several different approaches to group key management. These approaches can be divided into three main classes: centralized group key management protocols, decentralized architectures and distributed key management protocols. The three classes are described here and an insight given to their features and goals.

Our value added is their suitable integration into a security protocol exchange, designed at layer 2, in the 802.15.4 protocol stack, which permits to i) avoid Elliptic Point multiplications upon rekeying of previously paired devices, and ii) support mutual authentication while securing the protocol exchange. To prove its viability, the proposed Key Management Protocol has been implemented and assessed on severely constrained devices. As expected, but made explicit and quantiﬁed by our experimental performance evaluation, the usage of implicit certiﬁcates in conjunction with an optimized message exchange yields impressive gains in terms of airtime consumption with respect to state of the art schemes.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices that collect sensitive data, access control is more crucial than ever to safeguard IoT data from unauthorized use. To enforce access control policies without trusted online entity, one promising approach is to maintain a group key shared between a device and its current subscribers, such that the device can encrypt its data and only the subscribers can decrypt it. However, prior group key management (GKM) schemes fail to efﬁciently address new challenges introduced by the massive scale of IoT devices, dynamic memberships of users, and changes in the number of devices. This paper explores efﬁcient GKM to accommodate multiple devices (in addition to multiple users) and to handle frequent membership and device number changes. Inspired by the observation that devices with similar functionalities often have similar access permissions, we propose a two-tier GKM architecture called GROUPIT, in which each device is assigned to one of many predeﬁned groups, and key management is performed within each group as well as between groups to improve efﬁciency. Despite being conceptually simple, GROUPIT addresses technical challenges including: 1) preventing a malicious device from obtaining extra information about other devices in the same group and 2) ensuring forward/backward secrecy and preventing collusion attacks when gluing two existing GKMs together. The probability of a successful collusion attack quickly drops to 0.3\% after ﬁve membership changes even in a small device group (e.g., 8). This paper provides both theoretical analysis and a proof-of-concept implementation based on Alljoyn, an opensource IoT communication framework to demonstrate the feasibility of GROUPIT.},

	abstract = {The key management is the central element of network security. In fact, key distribution is necessary for securing applications in the context of Internet of Things (IoT). However, existing key management protocols are not directly applicable on IoT due, among other things, to severe and high resource constraints of some devices that make up the IoT network. Therefore, it is necessary that the proposed key management protocols takes in charge these features and constraints. Most existing solutions didn’t focus on optimizing, at the same time, all performance criteria, like communication, computation and storage. Some of them put special emphasis on minimizing one criteria but ignore the others. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight matrix based key management protocol for Iot network, which is not only ﬂexible, scalable and resilient to many types of attacks, but also can reduce the communication, computation and storage overheads at constrained nodes side. The security properties like authentication, integrity and secrecy have been checked by using the formal veriﬁcation tool AVISPA. Moreover, security and performance analysis show that our scheme protects user’s sensitive data from several types of attacks by achieving secure end-to-end communications, and optimizes the energy consumption, which is suitable for resource-limited networks.},
