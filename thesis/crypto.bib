	abstract = {Research into the security of the Internet of Things (IoT) needs to utilize particular algorithms that offer ultra-low power consumption and a long lifespan, along with other parameters such as strong immunity against attacks, lower chip area and acceptable throughput. This paper offers an ASIC-oriented comparative review of the most popular and powerful cryptographic algorithms worldwide, namely AES, 3DES, Twofish and RSA. The ASIC implementations of those algorithms are analyzed by studying statistical data extracted from the ASIC layouts of the algorithms and comparing them to determine the most suited algorithms for IoT hardwaresecurity applications. The AES algorithm is found to be the most suitable algorithm for IoT applications.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoTs) comprises of a cluster of resource constrained devices, sensors and machines connected with each other and communicating over the internet. Due to frequent exchange of confidential data over the internet, IoTs become susceptible to various attacks (such as eavesdropping, denial of service, fabrication attacks) and to resolve these attacks security is required. In this paper, a brief discussion on the various IoT applications and architectures has been done. Further, the security concerns regarding information sharing and attacks have been highlighted. To overcome from these attacks safety measures regarding data security and authentication are discussed in detail resulting in use of cryptography as a solution. The comparative analysis of various lightweight encryption and authentication algorithms is carried out. The comparative analysis results show that the lightweight algorithms have good performance as compared to conventional cryptography algorithm in terms of memory requirement, their operations, and power consumption. Also, some research directions defined in which further work can be done on lightweight cryptography algorithms.},

	abstract = {The future of Internet is “Intrnet of Things” where trillions of physical objects, most of them with low or extremely low resources, communicate with each other without human intervention. Light weight cryptography includes cryptographic algorithms specifically meant for extremely constrained resources. They can be applied not only for encryption but also for hashing and authentication under environments that are highly constrained. In this paper, we first discuss the need of light weight cryptography and their design differences with normal block ciphers. An overview of some of the light weight cryptographic algorithms is discussed after that. Also, we look into different types of attacks that has been studied on some of these ciphers. Finally, we compare the performance of some of these ciphers on Windows and Embedded platform.},
