	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) opens opportunities for wearable devices, home appliances, and software to share and communicate information on the Internet. Given that the shared data contains a large amount of private information, preserving information security on the shared data is an important issue that cannot be neglected. In this paper, we begin with general information security background of IoT and continue on with information security related challenges that IoT will encountered. Finally, we will also point out research directions that could be the future work for the solutions to the security challenges that IoT encounters.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a survey and analysis on the current status and concerns of Internet of things (IoT) security. The IoT framework aspires to connect anyone with anything at anywhere. IoT typically has a three layers architecture consisting of Perception, Network, and Application layers. A number of security principles should be enforced at each layer to achieve a secure IoT realization. The future of IoT framework can only be ensured if the security issues associated with it are addressed and resolved. Many researchers have attempted to address the security concerns specific to IoT layers and devices by implementing corresponding countermeasures. This paper presents an overview of security principles, technological and security challenges, proposed countermeasures, and the future directions for securing the IoT.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an increasingly popular technology that enables physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, etc., to communicate and even inter operate with one another. It has been widely used in industrial production and social applications including smart home, healthcare, and industrial automation. While bringing unprecedented convenience, accessibility, and efﬁciency, IoT has caused acute security and privacy threats in recent years. There are increasing research works to ease these threats, but many problems remain open. To better understand the essential reasons of new IoT threats and the challenges in current research, this survey ﬁrst proposes the concept of “IoT features.” Then, we discuss the security and privacy effects of eight IoT features including the threats they cause, existing solutions to threats and research challenges yet to be solved. To help researchers follow the up-to-date works in this ﬁeld, this paper ﬁnally illustrates the developing trend of IoT security research and reveals how IoT features affect existing security research by investigating most existing research works related to IoT security from 2013 to 2017.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things paradigm envisions the pervasive interconnection and cooperation of smart things over the current and future Internet infrastructure. The Internet of Things is, thus, the evolution of the Internet to cover the real world, enabling many new services that will improve people’s everyday lives, spawn new businesses, and make buildings, cities, and transport smarter. Smart things allow indeed for ubiquitous data collection or tracking, but these useful features are also examples of privacy threats that are already now limiting the success of the Internet of Things vision when not implemented correctly. These threats involve new challenges such as the pervasive privacy-aware management of personal data or methods to control or avoid ubiquitous tracking and proﬁling. This paper analyzes the privacy issues in the Internet of Things in detail. To this end, we ﬁrst discuss the evolving features and trends in the Internet of Things with the goal of scrutinizing their privacy implications. Second, we classify and examine privacy threats in this new setting, pointing out the challenges that need to be overcome to ensure that the Internet of Things becomes a reality.
